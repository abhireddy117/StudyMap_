A mobile/web app that uses maps to help people find study sessions

# Description
The idea behind this project is to create a mobile / web app that uses the google maps api and some sort of database backend to allow
users to post and schedule physical and virtual study sessions. We are also interested in canvas integration using their api to allow users 
to create study sessions for certain assignments, classes, and projects. Canvas integration could also alow for notifications to be recieved
on study sessions scheduled for classes that that indidvidual has.
